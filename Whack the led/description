The I implemented is "Whack the led".
It's based on the game "Whack the mole" where a mole pops up randomly, and if you hit it fast enough, you get points.

In my game, I changed the moles into leds.
If a led is blinking, The player needs to press a button.
If the player presses it fast enough, they get a point.

Tools-
1. Arduino uno
2. Leds (1 white 1 blue, 1 green and 1 yellow)
3. Buttons
4. wires
5. Breadboard

Software-
1. Arduino


At the beginnig, the player is asked to chhose a difficulty level (1, 2, 3 or 4).
1 is the easiest level and 4 is the most difficult.

The more difficult the level is, the faster the leds are blinking.

There are 4 leds and for buttons. One button for each led.

If led i is blinking, the player needs to press button i.

The player has 60 seconds to "whack" as many leds as possible (pressing the correct button for the blinking led).

At the end of the game, the player is told how many points they got.
