The I implemented is "Whack the led".
It's based on the game "Whack the mole" where a mole pops up randomly, and if you hit it fast enough, you get points.

In my game, I changed the moles into leds.
If a led is blinking, The player needs to press a button.
If the player presses it fast enough, they get a point.
